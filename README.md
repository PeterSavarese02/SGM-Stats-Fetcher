# SGM Stats Picture Tracker
A simple PHP program I made when I was 14. Goes to specified URL, takes a picture, crops it, and creaates a new picture from the cropped image. Used for putting in forum signatures on the https://seriousgmod.com website.

## Libraries Used
* ImageMagick

## Why?
I was bored and wanted to interface with something that didn't have an API. Granted this isn't really an API either as it isn't selecting individual values from each div element, rather just taking a screenshot of an existing page, cropping, and adding text but I still liked working with the PHP, library integration, and javascript.
